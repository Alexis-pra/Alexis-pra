### ðŸ‘‹ Hey, moi câ€™est Alexis

- ðŸ›  Iâ€™m currently working on expanding my dev skills to match my design brain.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning full stack dev: React, Node.js, MongoDB, Angular & Git.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that mix design & code.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with backend best practices.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about motion design, visual storytelling, or Figma vs. code debates.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I probably care way too much about font choicesâ€¦ even in terminal prompts.
